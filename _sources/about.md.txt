# About Project Pythia

Pythia is a community educational resource for helping students, scientists,
and educators learn how to analyze and visualize geosciences data using
the Scientific Python Ecosystem.

## Project Pythia Goals

1. _The Pythia Portal:_ A searchable online portal that
   provides scientists at any point in their career with educational
   content and real-world examples needed to learn how to navigate and
   integrate the myriad packages within the Python ecosystem for the
   geosciences.

2. _Cloud-Deployable Pythia Platforms:_ A light-weight,
   Binder-based platform that will make it possible to launch portal
   content in customizable executable environments in the Cloud with
   only a “single click.”
