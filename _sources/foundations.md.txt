# Project Pythia Foundations

We are currently developing a **comprehensive set of tutorials** covering the **foundational skills** everyone needs to get started with **scientific computing in the open-source Python ecosystem**. These foundational tutorials will serve as **common references** for more advanced and domain-specific content to be housed here in the Pythia Portal.

You can find the _under-construction_ Foundations content at <https://foundations.projectpythia.org/>.
